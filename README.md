# CodeLouisvilleFinalProject
This is my final project for Code Louisville Front End Session

My project is a questionaire to determine where someone could go based on certain possible outcomes.
At the end of the project if all criteria is answered and there is a result a sentence should pop up telling you where you can go on vacation.
If no criteria is met it will tell you at the end that is has no place for you to go.

Each question also provides feedback if the answer does not meet an answer that is listed.

This project has Javascript if/else if/else statements running the majority of the elements on the page.
It has media queries that give it a good setup for moblie users that line up the elements making them easier to read on a smaller screen.
It has commented out sections to help navigate the code if someone else is looking through it or I come back to it at a later date.
It has multiple CSS properties applied to each element.

It meets all the requirements of the Front End Project in the above list. Although I definitely see the need for improvement in my skills I enjoyed 
the experience and hope that I can come back to learn more.

Thank you.
